# Welcome to Logo Icons Lookup API üëã

[![Tests](https://github.com/frubesss/logo-icons-lookup-api/actions/workflows/lint-tests.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/frubesss/financial-logos-api-/actions/workflows/lint-tests.yml)

> This API allows consumers to find logo icons for a company based on string pattern matching.
> Fulfilling the use case where you want to display the logo icon of
> a company, but you only have a partial match of the company name.
>
> This is useful in scenarios where you are consuming company names from an API
> outside of your control, and you want to determine the icon for that company
> on end.
>
> For example: You want the company logo for American Express but the API you are consuming gives you American Express Europe Ltd.
> This API will return the American Express logo due to American Express being a pattern match.

## Usage

You have two choices.

1. Use the already hosted version of this API at
   https://logo-icons-lookup-api.deno.dev and add the company logo icons you
   require to this repository. Following the steps [here](#Contributing).

2. Fork this repository/use this template and host the API in your own deno
   deploy environment [here](https://deno.com/deploy/docs). Or even host it in
   your own serverless environment. (This has still yet to be tested).

## Contributing

### Add new logo icon

- Find the company logo icon you would like to add.
  [Brandfetch](https://www.brandfetch.com) is a great resource for finding good,
  high quality logos. If Brandfetch does not find the logo you want, you can
  also try [Clearbit logo](https://clearbit.com/logo)

- Ensure the logo is:
  - a square in dimensions, so 50x50, 100x100, 200x200 etc
  - not a duplicate of another logo in the repository
- Name the logo filename to the company it is representing
- Add the logo to the `logos` directory
- Create a PR, and GitHub actions will format it for you:
  - To a png
  - To a square
  - Compress the logo
